    <h2> Shaun Eddy</h2>
    <p> I was born and raised in California where I met my wife. We married about 6 years ago where I was instantly blessed with four kids. We had another together who is now 3 years old and really keeps us on our toes.</p>    
    <p> Back in my 20's I attended BYU Idaho on campus for a couple of years where I studied communications which ulitmately lead me to sales. I have recently decided to switch to coding and programming.</p>
    <p> So this is my first semester back and glad to be here with all of you. </p>
